Since its establishment, the club has focused on bridging the generational gap amongst students and seniors at the University and in the local community. Over the past five years, this student association has held several events where the members and guests have the opportunity to make intergenerational and intercultural connections. The  members come from various demographics, backgrounds and professions to make meaningful connections by sharing one anotherâ€™s experiences. These events leave each of the attendees with a strong sense of empathy and hearts filled with compassion for the other. "/>
